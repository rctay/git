-pkt-line Format
----------------
-
-Much (but not all) of the payload is described around pkt-lines.
-
-A pkt-line is a variable length binary string.  The first four bytes
-of the line indicates the total length of the line, in hexadecimal.
-The total length includes the 4 bytes used to denote the length.
-A line SHOULD BE terminated by an LF, which if present MUST be
-included in the total length.
-
-A pkt-line MAY contain binary data, so implementors MUST ensure all
-pkt-line parsing/formatting routines are 8-bit clean.  The maximum
-length of a pkt-line's data is 65532 bytes (65536 - 4).
-
-Examples (as C-style strings):
-
-  pkt-line          actual value
-  ---------------------------------
-  "0006a\n"         "a\n"
-  "0005a"           "a"
-  "000bfoobar\n"    "foobar\n"
-  "0004"            ""
-
-A pkt-line with a length of 0 ("0000") is a special case and MUST
-be treated as a message break or terminator in the payload.
