Subject: [PATCH 18/22] also mention locations matched by $GIT_URL for 404s

Junio's suggested text was not used, but the issue (no object found) was
addressed.

Based on:

  We may also want to add

      If there is no object at $GIT_URL/some/path, the server MUST respond
      with the '404 Not Found' HTTP status code.

  to help dumb clients.
