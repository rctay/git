Git v1.6.6 Release Notes
========================

In this release, "git fsck" defaults to "git fsck --full" and checks
packfiles, and because of this it will take much longer to complete
than before.  If you prefer a quicker check only on loose objects (the
old default), you can say "git fsck --no-full".  This has been
supported by 1.5.4 and newer versions of git, so it is safe to write
it in your script even if you use slightly older git on some of your
machines.

In git 1.7.0, which is planned to be the release after 1.6.6, "git
push" into a branch that is currently checked out will be refused by
default.

You can choose what should happen upon such a push by setting the
configuration variable receive.denyCurrentBranch in the receiving
repository.

Also, "git push $there :$killed" to delete the branch $killed in a remote
repository $there, when $killed branch is the current branch pointed at by
its HEAD, will be refused by default.

You can choose what should happen upon such a push by setting the
configuration variable receive.denyDeleteCurrent in the receiving
repository.

To ease the transition plan, the receiving repository of such a
push running this release will issue a big warning when the
configuration variable is missing.  Please refer to:

transition plan.

Updates since v1.6.5
--------------------

(subsystems)

 * various git-gui updates including new translations, wm states, etc.

(portability)

(performance)

(usability, bells and whistles)

 * The object replace mechanism can be bypassed with --no-replace-objects
   global option given to the "git" program.

 * "git bisect reset" can reset to an arbitrary commit.

 * "git checkout frotz" when there is no local branch "frotz" but there
   is only one remote tracking branch "frotz" is taken as a request to
   start the named branch at the corresponding remote tracking branch.

 * "git describe" can be told to add "-dirty" suffix with "--dirty" option.

 * "git diff" learned --submodule option to show a list of one-line logs
   instead of differences between the commit object names.

 * "git fsck" by default checks the packfiles (i.e. "--full" is the
   default); you can turn it off with "git fsck --no-full".

 * import-tars contributed fast-import frontend learned more types of
   compressed tarballs.

 * "git instaweb" knows how to talk with mod_cgid to apache2.

 * "git log --decorate" shows the location of HEAD as well.

 * "--pretty=format" option to "log" family of commands learned:

   . to wrap text with the "%w()" specifier.
   . to show reflog information with "%g[sdD]" specifier.

 * "git merge" (and "git pull") learned --ff-only option to make it fail
   if the merge does not result in a fast-forward.

 * "git mergetool" learned to use p4merge.

 * "git rebase -i" learned "reword" that acts like "edit" but immediately
   starts an editor to tweak the log message without returning control to
   the shell, which is done by "edit" to give an opportunity to tweak the
   contents.

 * "git svn" learned to read SVN 1.5+ and SVK merge tickets.

 * Author names shown in gitweb output are links to search commits by the
   author.
