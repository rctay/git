Subject: [PATCH] extract setting of wt_status.commitable flag out of wt_status_print_updated()

At first glance, wt_status_print_updated() appears to be doing a bunch
of printing (as its name implies), and it may not be immediately obvious
that it also sets the vital wt_status.commitable flag. Extract this out
into a separate function; it is hoped that the improved clarity to
future Git contributors would outweigh the performance penalty.
