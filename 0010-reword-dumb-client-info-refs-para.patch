Subject: [PATCH 10/17] reword dumb client info/refs para

---

Notes:
 - said "request to" instead of Junio's "request against", for
   consistency with the rest of the document.
 - said "E.g." instead of "I.e." since it's an example request and
   response

  It is unclear if '?' can be part of $GIT_URL. E.g.

      $ wget http://example.xz/serve.cgi?path=git.git/info/refs
      $ git clone http://example.xz/serve.cgi?path=git.git

  It might be clearer to just say

      Dumb HTTP clients MUST make a GET request against $GIT_URL/info/refs,
      without any search/query parameters.  I.e.

          C: GET $GIT_URL/info/refs HTTP/1.0

  to also exclude methods other than GET.
