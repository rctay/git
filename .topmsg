Subject: [PATCH] extract setting of wt_status.commitable flag out of wt_status_print_updated()

It may not be obvious from its name that wt_status_print_updated() that
it also sets wt_status.commitable, which affects commit functionality.
Extract this out into a separate function for improved clarity, though
at the expense of executing another loop.
