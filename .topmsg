Subject: rename STATUS_FORMAT_NONE to STATUS_FORMAT_DEFAULT

In f3f47a1 (status: add --long output format option), STATUS_FORMAT_NONE
was introduced, meaning "the user did not specify anything". Rename this
to *_DEFAULT to better indicate its meaning.

This paves the way for _NONE to really mean "no status".
