Subject: [PATCH] make commit --verbose work with --no-status

When running git-commit`, --verbose appends a diff to the prepared
message, while --no-status omits git-status output; thus, one would
expect --verbose --no-status to give a commit message with a diff of
the commit without git-status output.

However, this is not what happens - the prepared commit message body is
empty, entirely. (Needless to say, no diff is appended.) This is because
internally the git-status machinery is used to provide both the diff and
status output, but this machinery is skipped over entirely due to
--no-status.

We introduce a new status_format, STATUS_FORMAT_DIFFONLY, which triggers
the setting of the commitable flag, and the printing of the diff. This
is set only by git-commit, and when it detects that --verbose and
--no-status have been used.
