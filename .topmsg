Subject: [PATCH] make commit --verbose work with --no-status

One would expect 'git commit --verbose --no-status' to give a commit
message with a diff of the commit, sans the output of git-status.
However, this does not work currently; the commit message body is
entirely empty (diff is absent as well). This is because internally the
status machinery is used to provide both the diff and status output, but
it is skipped due to --no-status.

We introduce a new status_format, STATUS_FORMAT_NONE. Thus, we still
call run_status(), but produce nothing in place of the usual git-status
output. status_format is set only when git-commit is passed i)
--verbose, and ii) --no-status.
