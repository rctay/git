Subject: [PATCH] make commit --verbose work with --no-status

When running git-commit`, --verbose appends a diff to the prepared
message, while --no-status omits git-status output; thus, one would
expect --verbose --no-status to give a commit message with a diff of
the commit without git-status output.

However, this is not what happens - the prepared commit message body is
empty, entirely. (Needless to say, no diff is appended.) This is because
internally the git-status machinery is used to provide both the diff and
status output, but this machinery is skipped over entirely due to
--no-status.

We introduce a new status_format, STATUS_FORMAT_DIFFONLY. Thus, we still
go through the git-status machinery, but produce nothing in place of the
usual git-status output. status_format is set only when git-commit is
passed i) --verbose, and ii) --no-status.
