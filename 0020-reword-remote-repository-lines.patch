Subject: [PATCH 20/22] reword 'remote repository' lines

  The wording "remote repository" felt confusing.  I know it is "from the
  repository served by the server", but if it were named without
  "upload-pack", I might have mistaken that you are allowing to proxy a
  request to access a third-party repository by this server.  The same
  comment applies to the git-receive-pack service.
